## Steps done so far & procedure followed (Midterm Submission) :-
### 1. Basic Learning :
Gone through ‘opencv’ library modules from geeksforgeeks, etc. sites and learnt the basic functions used to detect corners, face, etc. from a YouTube playlist, provided by the mentor. Learning code files included in this repository.
### 2. Self Check Assignment :
Tried to solve the 'Self Check Assignment', as provided by the mentor, as much as possible. Code included in this repository.
### 3. CNN learning :
Gone through a youtube playlist on CNN and Image classification, as provided by the mentor which includes detailed analysis of image analysis and object detetion
modules.
### 4. Choosing topic (final) :
For training models (For the final project) the chosen object type to be detected is “Chocolates” (including wrappers). 
### 5. Data Collection :
Images (data set) of chocolates were collected from ‘Roboflow’ website and folders were created to train the model. <br><br>

<br>
### 6. Labelling Images :
The images are labelled and modified accoring to Robosflow workflow, making them suitable and ready for model training.

### 7. Model Training :
The model training is executed through online Robosflow Workflow method. It's in progress, as of now. <br>
